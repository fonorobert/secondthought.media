An office day, hard to focus in the heat. (not in the office yet, but I assume it will be) Stripped down the X100F to just the camera and a wriststrap, now it fits into the fanny pack I carry. Camera, cigarettes, notebook, hand sanitizer, headphones.

Air conditioned trains are great. It’s cool enough but I don’t get too cold, and being on a train is the perfect reason to not focus on anything, just hang out and relax until I arrive.
