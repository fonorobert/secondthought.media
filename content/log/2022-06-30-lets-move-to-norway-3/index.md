Craig Mod, in today’s edition of his Roden newsletter ([craigmod.com/roden/069/](https://craigmod.com/roden/069/)) talks about how Japan had a sensible reaction to COVID: no major lockdowns but just everybody please be careful, don’t go to crowded events and wear a mask most of the time.
This resulted in a lower number of deaths and also a saner, more “normal” life for everyone. This, paired with the ever worsening heat in the city makes me think: should we move somewhere else entirely, somewhere with sane social policies, with a measured, calm but conscious response to the pandemic, somewhere with lots of green and cool valleys to avoid the worst of the city heat?

I’m not saying I want to move to Norway, but I kind of want to move to Norway.
