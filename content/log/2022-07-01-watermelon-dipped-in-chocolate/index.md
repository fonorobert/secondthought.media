Waaay too hot, a 3-shower-day.
Balance of the day: shook on the new job I’m starting in a month, had a fun conversation about digitized cemeteries and privacy rights of the deceased, found out the car I’m driving tomorrow doesn’t have working AC, ate a bunch of fruit dippes in melted chocolate, found out the research ship my sibling is going on is actually a sailboat.

Good day on balance.
