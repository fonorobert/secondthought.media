The fire is shooting up its last flames, slowly collapsing into cooling embers. Moonlight shining blue on tired faces, everyone winding down, slowly digesting food and alcohol, smoking last cigarettes. Limbs heavy, eyelids like lead. Dog snoring in Johanna’s lap, the only one who doesn’t start to worry about cleaning up or finding a night bus home.
