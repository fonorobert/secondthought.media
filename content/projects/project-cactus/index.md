When someone says "enterprise software", designers tend to groan. Anybody who's ever used enterprise software tends to groan as well. But why is that? Why does enterprise software tend to be hard to use, clunky, uncomfortable, complicated?

I am trying to answer these questions and find a better way through building a prototype for a typical enterprise workflow: procurement.

As of spring 2023 I am deep into service design, laying out use cases, workflows, roles and affordances. Once I'm further into UI design and execution, I will share some of the results and my conclusions here.
