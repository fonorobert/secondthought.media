I serve as Project Manager at [DONE.](https://thisisdone.com/en/), a Budapest based software development agency.

I am experimenting with learning and thinking in public via [The Grove](https://notes.secondthought.media), my public collection of budding notes on a range of topics. My current focus there is management and workflows.

Since December 2022 I've been making a daily photography project, [Project 365](/projects/project-365/).
