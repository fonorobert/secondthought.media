## What's a digital garden?

TBD - basic explanation, links to maggie appleton or sg

## Why am I interested in this?

iterative learning, notes build topics as i gather new info, ideas

topography over timeline
iterative thinking
learning in public


## How would I structure my digital garden?

- note status (leaf, budding, etc)
- epistemic info (my confidence)


## Tools

- tiddlywiki
	web-only, not great, plus kinda weird UX
- notion
	very user friendly, but ugh, notion
- obsidian/roam/etc
	too complicated, easy to get lost in styling, config, etc.
