I'll start with the biggest event up front: on Tuesday we announced to my team that I'm leaving the company. By the time we got here I wasn't really anxious about making the announcement, but the few people that reached out afterwards still felt nice. Everyone is asking what I will do next and so far I've been just saying that I'm not sure, beyond taking a few weeks to relax.

I *am* kicking off "Project Day One" however, with little fanfare and no official "now it starts" moment, just incrementally.

*Day One is what I've dubbed my effort to create structure, plan and goals for myself after my contract ends ("first day of the rest of my life" is behind the name).*

On the top of my urgent/important list is a lot of administrative work, things I've been putting off for a while. During this week I've been slowly gathering these, putting a list together and thinking a bit about what each thing will require. My list is pretty boring, it has things like changing my phone contract, selling an old car that's been sitting in a parking lot for almost a year, that sort of stuff.

Another Day One focus that I've made progress with is ADHD treatment. I've been stuck in waiting list limbo to do the final step of my diagnosis. When I emailed the clinic now, they said that they can give me the diagnosis without a personal consult, and I can do the consult when they have an appointment for me. This was an exciting development, since with a diagnosis I can go to a different clinic for treatment without having to re-do the whole diagnostic process.

Finally, one interesting development this week is what you're reading now: a **weeknote**.
I've stumbled on the concept on [https://www.are.na](https://www.are.na). If you are interested, I can recommend [this overview](https://interconnected.org/home/2018/07/24/weeknotes) and [this post](https://medium.com/@jukesie/the-why-of-weeknotes-c1cd98967842).
